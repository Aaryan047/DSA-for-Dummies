DSA for Dummies | Beginner-Friendly Data Structures by Aaryan Vinod Kumar
Welcome to DSA for Dummies — a no-nonsense, beginner-friendly series where I break down Data Structures like you're five (but slightly more capable with a keyboard).

This repo is your one-stop guide if you're:

Confused by terms like "Linked List" and "Binary Tree"

New to programming and don’t know where to start

Tired of tutorials that assume you're already a genius

What’s Inside:
PDF Notes that actually make sense

C++ Code implementations with comments and examples

Step-by-step setup guides for Windows and Mac

Real talk — with analogies, humor, and zero jargon-overload

Why This Exists:
Because everyone starts somewhere. I did too — unga-bunga brain and all.
Let’s learn the basics, one silly-sounding structure at a time.

Tech Stack:
Language: C++

Editor: Visual Studio Code

Compiler: MinGW / GCC

Pull requests, issues, and suggestions are welcome.
Let’s make DSA chill again.
